# Internship Project Readme

## Description
This repository contains the code for an internship project consisting of two tasks. Task-1 involves creating a landing page with a navigation bar, while Task-2 involves implementing a to-do list.

## Task-1: Landing Page with Navigation Bar
For Task-1, we created a simple landing page with a navigation bar. The navigation bar is designed to enhance user experience by providing easy access to different sections of the website. The landing page aims to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

- HTML
- CSS

### Files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and CSS styling for the landing page and navigation bar.

## Task-2: To-Do List

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the to-do list application.
